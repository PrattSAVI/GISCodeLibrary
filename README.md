# GISCodeLibrary
This is a library of code for students in GIS-related courses at Pratt Institute. These are Python, R, and JavaScript tools that might help you build better maps, manage data more efficiently, or perform specialized spatial analysis. Materials are either borrowed from public repositories or produced by Pratt faculty and students (please cite according to the documentation on each individual item).
